// API Configuration
// Works with both development (Vite proxy) and Docker (relative paths via nginx)

// In development: Vite proxy is configured to forward /team9/api to localhost:8000
// In Docker: nginx gateway proxies /team9/api to core:8000
// Both use relative paths, so they work transparently
